# go-libheif
 GoLang wrapper for the libheif library, providing easy-to-use APIs for HEIC to JPEG/PNG conversions and vice versa (Also provides support for AVIF to JPEG/PNG conversions).      
 This package was originally developed to support the [php-heic-to-jpg](https://github.com/MaestroError/php-heic-to-jpg) package, which had [problems](https://github.com/MaestroError/php-heic-to-jpg/issues/15) while converting some HEIF images.   

#### Implementation:
- For a swift start, consider browsing our [quickstart guide](https://medium.com/@revaz.gh/using-the-go-libheif-module-for-converting-images-between-the-heic-format-and-other-popular-formats-e7829165c368) on Medium.
- If you're primarily interested in a hassle-free image conversion tool, we have already integrated this module into a Command Line Interface (CLI) application and a docker image, available [here](https://github.com/MaestroError/heif-converter-image).

### Prerequisites
You need to install [libheif](https://github.com/strukturag/libheif) before using this module. You can check the [strukturag/libheif](https://github.com/strukturag/libheif) for installation instructions, but as I have found, the easiest way for me was to use [brew](https://brew.sh/):
```bash
brew install cmake make pkg-config x265 libde265 libjpeg libtool
brew install libheif
```
*Note: Pay attention to the brew's recommendation while installing*    

You can find installation scripts in [heif-converter-image](https://github.com/MaestroError/heif-converter-image) repository with names:
- install-libheif.sh
- install-libheif-macos.sh
- install-libheif-windows.bat

*If the installation process seems a bit challenging, we recommend to consider using the [heif-converter-image](https://github.com/MaestroError/heif-converter-image) which offers a ready-to-use docker image.*

### Installation
```bash
go get github.com/MaestroError/go-libheif
```

### Usage
This library provides functions to convert images between HEIC format and other common formats such as JPEG and PNG.       
          
To convert an image from HEIC / HEIF / AVIF to JPEG or PNG:
```go
package main

import (
	"log"

	"github.com/MaestroError/go-libheif"
)

func main() {
	err := libheif.HeifToJpeg("input.heic", "output.jpeg", 80)
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}
	
	err = libheif.HeifToPng("input.heic", "output.png")
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}
}

```

To convert an image from JPEG or PNG to HEIC:
```go
package main

import (
	"log"

	"github.com/MaestroError/go-libheif"
)

func main() {
	err := libheif.ImageToHeif("input.jpeg", "output.heic")
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}
}

```
*Note: It finds hard to convert some jpeg and png files to heic, see libheif_test.go:14 for details*       
           
To save an image as HEIC:
```go
package main

import (
	"image"
	"log"

	"github.com/MaestroError/go-libheif"
)

func main() {
	img := image.NewRGBA(image.Rect(0, 0, 100, 100))
	err := libheif.SaveImageAsHeif(img, "png", "output.heic")
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}
}

```
*Note: Quality for **HeifToJpeg** function and image format for **SaveImageAsHeif** function should be provided. The quality value ranges from 1 to 100 inclusive, higher values meaning better quality. The format for **SaveImageAsHeif** is the format of the original image.*       

Please consult the GoDoc [documentation](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/MaestroError/go-libheif) for more detailed information about the provided functions and their usage.
